PEP 526 introduced variable annotations. The style recommendations for them are
similar to those on function annotations described above:

- Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables,
  and local variables should have a single space after the colon.

- There should be no space before the colon.

- If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have
  exactly one space on both sides::

      # Correct:

      code: int

      class Point:
          coords: Tuple[int, int]
          label: str = '<unknown>'

  ::

      # Wrong:

      code:int  # No space after colon
      code : int  # Space before colon

      class Test:
          result: int=0  # No spaces around equality sign

- Although the PEP 526 is accepted for Python 3.6, the variable annotation
  syntax is the preferred syntax for stub files on all versions of Python
  (see PEP 484 for details).

.. [#fn-hi] *Hanging indentation* is a type-setting style where all
   the lines in a paragraph are indented except the first line.  In
   the context of Python, the term is used to describe a style where
   the opening parenthesis of a parenthesized statement is the last
   non-whitespace character of the line, with subsequent lines being
   indented until the closing parenthesis
